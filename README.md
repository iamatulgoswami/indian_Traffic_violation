# City Traffic Signal Violation Analysis

## Project Overview
Traffic signal violations are a major reason for road accidents in cities.  
This project studies city traffic signal violation data using **Python Pandas** to understand
common types of violations, unsafe locations, and vehicle-related patterns.  
The main aim of this analysis is to gain insights into traffic safety and highlight the
importance of following traffic rules.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To analyze traffic signal violation data using Pandas
- To find the most frequent types of traffic violations
- To study violations based on traffic signals and vehicle types
- To visualize violation data using bar charts
- To understand traffic safety issues from the analysis


## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project was collected from **Kaggle**.  
It contains traffic signal violation records from an Indian city.

### Important Columns:
- date – Date when the violation occurred
- city – City of the violation
- signal_id – Identification number of the traffic signal
- location – Location of the traffic signal
- violation_type – Type of traffic violation
- vehicle_type – Type of vehicle involved
- violation_count – Number of violations recorded

The dataset was cleaned and analyzed independently for academic purposes.


## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas for data analysis
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- VS Code / Jupyter Notebook
- Git and GitHub for version control

## Project Methodology
The following steps were followed in this project:
1. Imported the required Python libraries
2. Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
3. Explored the dataset using `df.info()` and `df.describe()`
4. Analyzed violation counts using `value_counts()`
5. Created bar charts to visualize the data
6. Studied traffic safety patterns and summarized conclusions


## Analysis Performed
- Analysis of different types of traffic violations
- Vehicle-wise violation analysis
- Traffic signal-wise violation study
- Location-based violation analysis
- Date-wise violation trend analysis

## Results & Observations
- Red light jumping is the most common traffic violation
- Two-wheelers are involved in a large number of violations
- Some traffic signals show consistently high violation counts
- Busy city locations record more traffic violations

## Traffic Safety Insights
The analysis shows that many traffic violations occur due to unsafe driving behavior
and lack of awareness of traffic rules.  
Stricter enforcement, better monitoring, and increased public awareness can help
reduce traffic signal violations and improve road safety.


## Conclusion
This project shows how **Pandas** can be used to analyze real-world traffic signal data
in a simple and effective way.  
The findings from this analysis can support better traffic management and road safety
decisions.

## Future Scope
- Analysis of traffic violations based on time of day
- Identifying accident-prone traffic signals
- Applying machine learning techniques for predicting violations
